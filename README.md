HTML client and encrypted proxy based on trustless technology (better than zero trust)
Web project in pure static HTML, with JavaScript code for encrypted communication with the cloud server. The communication in order to skip any firewal and to communicate a server without static IP uses a proprietary proxy software.
It is necessary to launch the proxy software before using the API and then reach the Server.

In this project you find a static HTML client, for the proxy, which works as a single file without dependencies in order to exacerbate the security at the highest level.
The HTML file (the client) can be copied to your desktop, and opened as a static file by the browser: It doesn't need a server to work, the encrypted communication code is all inside the page, clear, simple, and demonstrates to the experts that it is a rogue, low-level encryption that also hides the data from the proxy/server or the VPN (which normally doesn't happen since the VPN is encrypted only up to the VPN server, the server sees everything unencrypted and from there on there is more encryption).
Our system guarantees maximum privacy and security, no intermediaries, between your HTML client and the cloud.
The HTML client doesn't have a server side, it's a static page that works open everywhere, so feel sure that there is no backend that can spy on you, open source encryption of all our code, proves that this is a trustless app: Comparable to the technology of projects like Bitcoin (we even use Bitcoin libraries to implement their security concepts!).

NOTE:

Any omitted dependencies in this repository, relating to encryption socket protocols, can be found published open source under our account or as nuget packages to be regerended to projects!
